# iProtector Forked by Genboy
PocketMine plugin maintained by [poggit-orphanage](https://github.com/poggit-orphanage/iProtector) 

Default protection settings in the config.yml file and straight forward commands to create and set flags for specific areaâ€™s. 
Command examples:
/area <pos1/pos2/create/flag/list/delete>
/area pos1
/area pos2
/area create <areaname>
/area flag <areaname> <permission>
usage ie.
/area flag Myarea edit false
/area flag Myarea touch false


Forked for testing ie. add more options/flags like 
- area custom entry- and leave-messages
- area trigger commands on entry, leave and after time spend in area.
